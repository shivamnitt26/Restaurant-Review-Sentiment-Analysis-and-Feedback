## Introduction
This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model capable of analyzing and classifying restaurant reviews as positive or negative. The purpose is to assist restaurants in understanding customer sentiments more efficiently and deriving actionable insights from customer feedback.

## Project Overview
Background
Restaurants rely heavily on customer reviews to gauge the quality of their food, service, ambiance, and pricing. Manually analyzing these reviews is a time-intensive task, especially with the large volumes of data that popular restaurants generate. This project seeks to automate the sentiment analysis process using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a robust sentiment analysis tool that can accurately classify customer reviews as positive or negative and suggest areas for improvement based on negative feedback.

## Features
### Text Preprocessing:
Cleaning text data by removing HTML tags, special characters, and stopwords.
Stemming words to their root form for consistency.
### Feature Extraction:
Utilizing TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert textual data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.
### Model Building:
Implementing a RandomForestClassifier to classify reviews.
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for optimizing model performance.
### Sentiment Prediction:
Predicting whether a given review is positive or negative.
### Improvement Suggestions:
Analyzing negative reviews to provide targeted suggestions for improving food, service, ambiance, and pricing.
## Technologies Used
### Programming Language: Python
### Libraries:
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation.
NLTK: For text processing and sentiment analysis.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model building and evaluation.
Matplotlib: For visualization.
